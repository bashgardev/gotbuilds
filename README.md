# GOT Legends Loadout Tool

A tool to create, and share loadouts for Ghost of Tsushima: Legends online multiplayer game.

Create and name a loadout, simply share it by copying the full URL, no need to create an account. The loadout information is encoded in a URL parameter, allowing to save loadouts to your Bookmarks. No need to take many screenshots to share a all perks and techniques.

This tool is useful when trying to build loadouts even if you don't own the item in the game yet. Allowing you to easily switch properties and perks to match a preferred playstyle. Handy tiptools appear on most screen items, allowing you to see the in-game description of such item.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
